# Privacy Policy for LabelAIScanner

Last updated: January 30, 2026

## Overview

LabelAIScanner is designed with a "privacy-first" philosophy. We believe that
your personal content belongs to you. This application is built to ensure that
your sensitive information—such as images and scanned text—remains private and
stays on your device.

## Data Collection & Usage

### Core Content

LabelAIScanner **does not collect, store, or transmit your personal images or
scanned text**.

- Any images you scan or text processed by the AI stays exclusively on your
  device.
- We do not have access to your photo library beyond what you specifically
  select for scanning.
- We do not collect usage statistics or analytics regarding how you use the
  app's scanning features.

### Subscription & Billing Data

To provide and manage premium features, LabelAIScanner uses third-party services
for subscription management. When you purchase a subscription:

- **Apple:** Your purchase is processed by Apple via your App Store account. We
  do not have access to your credit card or personal billing details.
- **RevenueCat:** We use RevenueCat to manage subscriptions and verify your
  purchase status. RevenueCat may process a unique, anonymized identifier and
  transaction history to ensure your premium features are active across your
  devices. This data is used solely for subscription validation.

## Internet Access

While the core functionality of LabelAIScanner works offline, the app
**accesses the internet for the following specific purposes**:

- Communicating with **Apple servers** to process App Store transactions.
- Communicating with **RevenueCat** to validate subscription status and manage
  entitlements.
- **No personal content (images or text) is ever transmitted during these
  connections.**

## Apple Intelligence & On-Device Processing

All artificial intelligence features in LabelAIScanner are powered by
**Apple Intelligence**, Apple's on-device Large Language Model (LLM) technology.

- All AI analysis occurs locally on your iPhone or iPad.
- Your data never leaves your device for the purpose of AI analysis.
- We do not use any cloud-based AI services or external LLM providers.

## Third-Party Services

We only share data with third parties to the extent necessary to provide the
subscription service:

- **RevenueCat:** [Privacy Policy](https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy)
- **Apple:** [Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/)

## Changes to This Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Our commitment to
maintaining on-device privacy for your personal scans remains our primary focus.
